### 🚀 About Me

I am an **ambitious Cyber Security learner** currently expanding my knowledge in system administration, networking, and defensive practices. My passion lies in understanding how systems work from the ground up, which drives my current learning projects: building a personal home server. In addition to take I am pursuing game development as a hobby.

I believe in continuous learning and applying technical skills to real-world scenarios.
